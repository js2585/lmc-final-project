        Welcome to RealDealReveal, your educational resource in the fight
        against AI misinformation! RealDealReveal is your best resource for
        understanding the current uses of generative AI in journalism, ethical
        implications of AI images, and instructional tools to help you identify
        AI generated images.

      <p>
        The emergence of AI image generation models came with a myriad of
        negative effects on the journalistic integrity. Misinformation has never
        been easy to spread online, a simple prompt to image generators such as
        Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion gives users instant access to
        anything they can imagine. Artificial images are frequently used to
        spread misinformation and political propaganda. Being able to tell the
        difference between real and fake images has never been harder - and
        never more important.
      </p>

        Not only does AI art affect journalism, but it also has a direct impact
        on artists and photographers. Economic opportunity loss, plagiarism, and
        copyright infringement are just a few of the harms that digital artists
        have mentioned because of generative AI models. There is little
        incentive for companies to commission artwork when cheap art is
        available instantly using generative models.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        One of the main criticisms of generative AI is that many of the models
        used today have been trained on copywritten data, presenting an ethical
        and legal dilemma for those whose content has been stolen. Many artists
        feel that their ideas and artwork are being stolen by AI that have
        trained on their previous works. Due to the permanence of the internet,
        it is likely that even with legal action, it will be extremely difficult
        to dispose of these models. In the interest of digital artists, the best
        course of action is to mitigate the existing damages done the industry
        using digital tools and education. To normal users, this means increased
        awareness on the proliferation of these images and active learning to
        better identify misinformation before hitting post. Take our QUIZ below
        to test your ability at spotting AI!

      <p>
        Being able to identify the differences between AI generated images and
        real images is getting harder as models improve, but even just a few
        simple tips can greatly increase your chances of spotting AI. Here's a
        few that you should look for:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Look at the small details:</strong>
          AI art isn't perfect and often these imperfections are in the details.
          For animals and humans look at the eyes, ears, fingers, and limbs to
          spot blurring, clipping, or irregularities that wouldn't appear on a
          normal picture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lighting:</strong> AI can struggle to create realistic
          lighting patterns. Look at shadows and reflections to see if the
          angles align with their light sources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Smoothing:</strong> AI often struggles to create realistic
          textures, so we suggest looking at surfaces and skin to spot unnatural
          smoothing. If it looks too good to be true, it likely is!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Text:</strong> AI often generates shaky or even illegible
          text. Look towards signs and scripts to see if the text is legible or
          even in a real language!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Realism:</strong> Context is crucial to spotting fake images.
          If an image is out of place or seems impossible, think twice before
          believing it!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p>
        These are just a few simple tips to help you spot fake images but the
        best way to learn is to practice! Take our short quiz below to put your
        skills to the test!
